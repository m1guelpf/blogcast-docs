::: warning Keep an eye on the plan!

Now that you have an account, let's get your first article into Blogcast.

::: warning You'll be billed!
Remember we selected the _Pay per Article_ plan before? This means each article you add to Blogcast will cost you **$0.5**. Keep this in mind before proceeding.
:::

To get started, navigate to [the Blogcast dashboard](https://blogcast.host/dashboard). Paste the link of the article you want to use on the input that says _Link to your article_, and click the _Select Voice_ button.

A modal will open asking you for which voice to use. You can filter voices by language and gender, and listen to a sample. Once you're satisfied, click the _Select_ button to submit the form.

You'll get a success message, and our system will start transcribing the article. This process can last between one and five minutes, so feel free to close the page if you want. In fact, I encourage you to close your computer and walk a little bit around your desk. You'll get an email when it's finished!
