# Embedding the Blogcast player on Medium

### Why can't I simply use the provided HTML?

If you're using Medium to publish your articles and have tried to follow the [Starter Guide](/), you'll have noticed Medium doesn't allow you to include raw HTML embeds.

Medium mantains a list of the providers you can embed on your articles, and blocks anything that isn't on the list. Fortunately, Blogcast is!

The steps for adding the Blogcast player to your Medium article are simple. First, you'll have to navigate to [your dashboard](https://blogcast.host/dashboard) and click on the _Manage audio_ button.

Once the modal opens, click on the _Using Medium?_ link located above the embed code block. It should display a URL like `https://blogcast.host/embedly/...`. That's the URL that'll tell Medium what player you're going to embed, so make sure to copy it to your clipboard.

Next, navigate to the Medium editor and find a good place for the player (hint: the best place is on the top, so people don't have to scroll to see it). Paste the URL on a new line, and hit enter. You should see the Blogcast player magically appear! :sparkles:
