# Embedding the Blogcast player on your website

If neither of the importing guides suit your setup (or you don't want to do it personally), you can hire [me](https://miguelpiedrafita.com) to setup Blogcast embeds on your website.

For `$20`, I'll setup your website to automatically display embeds on all the articles you've added to Blogcast. That way, every time you publish an article and add it to Blogcast, the embed will automatically show up!

In case you're using a closed platform where automation is not possible (e.g. Medium), I'll manually add it to your existing ones and write a detailed guide on how you can add the embed to your new articles by yourself.

I'll optionally add all your existing articles to Blogcast and setup [Blogcast Sync](sync) so new articles get added to Blogcast automatically for `$5` (article price not included).
